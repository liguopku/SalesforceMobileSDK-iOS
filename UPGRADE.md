## Upgrade steps from v. 5.0.x to v. 5.1 for native/hybrid/react native apps

To upgrade native, hybrid and react native apps, we strongly recommend creating a new app from the app templates in [the forceios npm package](https://npmjs.org/package/forceios), then migrating the artifacts specific to your app into the new template. The other recommended approach would be to upgrade using [Cocoapods](https://github.com/forcedotcom/SalesforceMobileSDK-iOS-Specs).

See the [Mobile SDK Development Guide](https://github.com/forcedotcom/SalesforceMobileSDK-Shared/blob/master/doc/mobile_sdk.pdf?raw=true) for more information about developing hybrid apps with the Mobile SDK and Cordova.
